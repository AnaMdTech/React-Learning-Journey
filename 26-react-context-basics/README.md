# 26 - React Context Basics

## Overview
In this mini-project, we learned about **React Context** and how it helps manage global state in your application without the need to pass props through every component. We created a simple **UserContext** to manage user data and share it across multiple components.

## Features
- `UserContext`: Manages user data like name and email.
- `Profile`: Displays the current user details.
- `User`: Allows the user to update their name.


## Key Concepts
- **Context**: A way to share values across components without prop drilling.
- **Provider**: Wraps components to supply context data.
- **useContext**: Hook used to consume context data in components.

## Next Steps
- Experiment with more complex contexts like authentication or theme toggling.
