# 🚀 React Learning Journey

Welcome to my personal React learning journey! 🧠💻

This repository is a curated collection of **mini projects** that help reinforce core concepts in React — from beginner fundamentals to more advanced topics — one concept at a time. Each folder is standalone and focuses on a specific topic so you can learn, build, and grow at your own pace.

---

## 📚 What You'll Find Here

Each mini project comes with:
- ✅ A clear goal and explanation
- 🔍 A focused concept (like JSX, Components, Props, or State)
- 🛠️ A working example to play with and modify
- 📘 A `README.md` inside the folder describing what the project teaches

---

## 🧩 Projects

| No. | Project | Concept | Description |
|----|---------|---------|-------------|
| 01 | `jsx-basics` | JSX | Learn how React elements are structured using JSX |
| 02 | `react-components` | Components | Break UIs into reusable building blocks |
| 03 | `props-practice` | Props | Pass data from parent to child components |
| 04 | `state-toggle` | useState | Manage local state and update UI dynamically |

## 🎯 Why I’m Doing This
