# 20 - Search Filtering with useEffect

This project demonstrates how to implement a basic search functionality in React using `useState` and `useEffect`.

## Key Concepts

- Controlled input fields
- `useEffect` to trigger side effects based on input change
- Filtering a static list of users

## What You'll Learn

- How `useState` controls form input
- How `useEffect` runs when specific state values change
- Efficient search techniques using array `.filter()`

## Try It Out

1. Type a name in the search bar.
2. Watch the list of users filter in real-time based on your input.
