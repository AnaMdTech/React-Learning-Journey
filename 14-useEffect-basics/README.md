# 14-useEffect-basics

ðŸŽ¯ This project demonstrates how to use the `useEffect` hook to handle side effects like:

- Listening to browser events (window resize, network status)
- Cleaning up side effects when the component unmounts

---

## ðŸ’¡ Key Concepts

- `useEffect(() => {}, [])` runs only on mount
- You can add **event listeners**, **fetch data**, or **sync external state**
- Always clean up your side effects to avoid memory leaks

---

## ðŸš€ What Youâ€™ll Learn

- React component lifecycle with `useEffect`
- Using multiple `useEffect` hooks for different effects
- Managing and cleaning up browser event listeners

---

## ðŸ§ª Try It Yourself

1. Resize your browser â€” the width updates!
2. Turn off Wi-Fi or simulate offline mode â€” status updates instantly!
