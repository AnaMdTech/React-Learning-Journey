# ðŸ”¹ 02 - React Components: User Profile Card

## ðŸš€ What You'll Learn

This mini project introduces the **core idea of React Components**. You'll learn:

- How to break UI into reusable pieces (components)
- How to pass data between components using **props**
- How to structure your files and components for real-world development
- How to make your JSX more modular and readable

## ðŸ§± Components Breakdown

- `App.jsx`: Renders the entire application and wraps the profile card.
- `ProfileCard.jsx`: Composes all smaller components (Avatar + UserInfo).
- `Avatar.jsx`: A presentational component for the profile image.
- `UserInfo.jsx`: Displays name, role, and a list of skills using props.

## ðŸ’¡ What You'll Build
